# Computer-Vision-Open-CV-
Basics of Computer Vision


Following is a repository for Computer Vision using python (PyCharm and OpenCV). I've divided the basics in simple chapters to make the learning part more interesting. (Not at all an original idea).
Before implementing all of this, please check that you have python version 3.6 or above. If not, download from python.org
Lastly, once you create a project in PyCharm, add OpenCV interpreter to the project for all these codes to execute correctly.


CHAPTER 1:-

Reading an image, a video, or feed from your own webcam using OpenCV. (Read_Images_Video.py)


CHAPTER 2:-

Exploring some basic functionalities and playing around with some images. (Basic_Functions.py)


CHAPTER 3:-

Resizing and Cropping images according to one's own convinience. (Resize_Crop.py)


CHAPTER 4:-

Creating a blank images and inserting shapes and text on that image. (Shapes_Text.py)


CHAPTER 5:-

Extracting some features from images using warp perspective. The pixels are scraped from paint. (Warp.py)


CHAPTER 6:-

Joining and Stacking images. The stacking images function is quite tedious, there;s no need to get into its details.
It's a combination of vertical and horizontal stack used for matrix like stacking of images (Joining_Images.py)


CHAPTER 7:-

Colour Detection using Trackbars to finalize which colour we want to extract. (Colour_Detection.py)


CHAPTER 8:-

Detecting Shapes from a particular image and classifying them. (Contour_Detection.py)


CHAPTER 9:-

Face Detection using a dataset of many images, which is an xml file which needs to be loaded in your folder to make sure the code is accurate. (Face_Detection.py)

PROJECT 1:-

Finally moving on to working models, first one is a virtual painting canvas using web cam. (Virtual_Paint.py)


PROJECT 2:-

Detecting and Scanning documents using web cam. (Document_Scanner.py)


PROJECT 3:-

Detecting Number Plates from Traffic Video. (Number_Plate_Detector.py)
