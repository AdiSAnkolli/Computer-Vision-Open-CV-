Basics of Computer Vision


Following is a repository for Computer Vision using python (PyCharm and OpenCV). I've divided the basics in simple chapters to make the learning part more interesting. (Not at all an original idea).


CHAPTER 1:-

Reading an image, a video, or feed from your own webcam using OpenCV. (Read_Images_Video.py)


CHAPTER 2:-

Exploring some basic functionalities and playing around with some images. (Basic_functions.py)
