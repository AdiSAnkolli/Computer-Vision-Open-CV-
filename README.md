# Computer-Vision-Open-CV-
Basics of Computer Vision


Following is a repository for Computer Vision using python (PyCharm and OpenCV). I've divided the basics in simple chapters to make the learning part more interesting. (Not at all an original idea).
Before implementing all of this, please check that you have python version 3.6 or above. If not, download from python.org
Lastly, once you create a project in PyCharm, add OpenCV interpreter to the project for all these codes to execute correctly.


CHAPTER 1:-

Reading an image, a video, or feed from your own webcam using OpenCV. (Read_Images_Video.py)


CHAPTER 2:-

Exploring some basic functionalities and playing around with some images. (Basic_Functions.py)


CHAPTER 3:-

Resizing and Cropping images according to one's own convinience. (Resize_Crop.py)
